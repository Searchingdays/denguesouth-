Dengue 

Lancet Household Survey data on Dengue was conducted in 
by calculating seroprevalence in 3 different age groups. 3 states of south India were examined- Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh. No information was given as to which districts were included so I considered the one of the most densely populated districts, Chennai. 
Using data from the Census of 2011, for the slums in Chennai, I used the data on 22 slum areas to calculate the number of persons per household, length of paved roads per person, water availability, sanitation availability and the prevalence of electric connections.

Aedes mosquito was originally found or is native to low elevation areas in the tropics and subtropics, since Chennai falls in this area, with a warm and humid climate throughout the year, rains promote still water collection, cyclones might also contribute to water collecting and mosquitoes breeding.

Average 15 households rely on a single tap, which might force people to collect and store water and use it very sparingly, only for essentials like cooking, and not waste it on things that are not really necessary. Schemes like Jal Jeevan Mission is a necessary step in such areas.

Approximately, 75% of households have latrines, but no information on piped water connections to home is given. The swachh Bharat mission launched in 2014 was supposed to deal with this issue.

Alverage no. of members per household is 4.2 for all slums nearly.

90% of the houses had electricity connection. these could be excellent targets for the rooftop solar initiative of the government, as the consumption is unlikely to be over 300 units per month, moreover they will be able to sell back the extra electricity to the grid and earn some extra income. In this process the 10% who do not have access to electricity, but live in the same area can also be brought under this scheme by the government.
