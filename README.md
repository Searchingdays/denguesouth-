Dengue 
Lancet Household Survey data on Dengue was conducted in 
by calculating seroprevalence in 3 different age groups. 3 states of south India were examined- Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh. No information was given as to which districts were included so I considered the one of the most densely populated districts, Chennai. 
Using data from the Census of 2011, for the slums in Chennai, I used the data on 22 slum areas to calculate the number of persons per household, length of paved roads per person, water availability, sanitation availability and the prevalence of electric connections
